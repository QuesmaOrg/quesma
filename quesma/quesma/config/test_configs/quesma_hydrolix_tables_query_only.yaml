# Use case:
# * user has some indices in Elasticsearch
# * user has two tables in Hydrolix named `siem` and `logs`
#
#  User wants to see those two Hydrolix tables as Elasticsearch indices in Kibana
#  User wants to see all their Elasticsearch indices in Kibana as they were before
#
#  ( ingest is not the case here, but the config has to be present due to impl. constraints )
