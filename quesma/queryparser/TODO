1. Main goal is to make queryparser/aggregation_parser_test.go/Test2AggregationParserExternalTestcases work
It's called like this to run only this test easily via `go test -run Test2`

Status:
("aggregation" part, "hits" aren't supported at all now...)
[0] - works
[1] - almost works, this isn't present: "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0, "sum_other_doc_count": 0
[2] - needs some more work - double/3x/4x/... aggregation ([]buckets: []buckets ([]buckets...) doesn't work)
[3] - works
[4] - almost works, this isn't present: "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0, "sum_other_doc_count": 0
[5] - works
[6] - almost works, buckets are [], not {} like in response :( It's stupid, first try as it is, maybe it'll work...
[7] - needs some more work - double/3x/4x/... aggregation ([]buckets: []buckets ([]buckets...) doesn't work)


2. send COUNT(*) query for "hits" field
3. "query" part of the request fully works. "aggs" is about to work (I hope).
   Need to combine those two, so look at "query" when dealing with "aggs". Now we only look "aggs".
