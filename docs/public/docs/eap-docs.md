# What is Quesma?

Quesma is an actively developed database gateway currently in Early Access Preview. Route your queries through a translation layer that seamlessly connects your apps with the modern database platforms of your choice. No more query refactoring during migrations.

In its current (Early Access Preview) form, Quesma is a lightweight database proxy that enables database interoperability between Elasticsearch/OpenSearch and ClickHouse/Hydrolix.


The high-level architecture is as follows:
```mermaid
graph LR
    In[Incoming traffic, e.g. Kibana] --> |HTTP requests| Q[Quesma]
    Q[Quesma] --> |HTTP response| In 
    Q --> Ch[ClickHouse/Hydrolix]
    Q --> ES[Elasticsearch/OpenSearch]
```

Essentially, Quesma speaks Elasticsearch API and can source data from both Elasticsearch indices and [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com) or [Hydrolix](https://hydrolix.io) tables.

## Quick start demo

The easiest way to get try out Quesma is to run the example `docker-compose` setup, which includes sample data and is pre-configured with example datasets.
