# A/B testing

Quesma can help validate your migration by sending queries to both Elasticsearch and ClickHouse simultaneously and comparing the results. This allows you to verify that queries return equivalent results from both systems before fully switching over.

You can enable A/B testing on an individual index level or for all (unconfigured) indexes via `*`. The configuration supports specifying which source (Elasticsearch or ClickHouse) should be the primary source to return results from and compare to.

Apart from validating correctness, A/B testing also measures the execution time difference (speedups or slowdowns) and generates a report per each dashboard and index.

## Configuration

Enabling A/B testing is as simple as adding two targets to an index:

```yaml
processors:
  - name: my-query-processor
    type: quesma-v1-processor-query
    config:
      indexes:
        kibana_sample_data_ecommerce:
          target: [ backend-elastic, backend-clickhouse ]
```

The order of targets matters in the configuration - the first target will be the primary target that Kibana (or other applications) receives results from. In the example above, Quesma will:

1. Receive an incoming query from Kibana/OpenSearch Dashboards
2. Send the same query to both Elasticsearch and ClickHouse 
3. Compare the responses to ensure they match
4. Return the response from the Elastic to the client
5. Log any discrepancies for analysis

## A/B testing report

In the Quesma managment UI (default port `9999`) the "A/B" tab shows a compatibility report based on the collected data:

![Kibana dashboards compatibility report](./public/quesma-ab/ab-1.png)

Upon clicking on the "Details" link, you can see a more detailed information about the discovered mismatch between sources.

### Analyzing A/B testing report

The compatibility report allows you to find potential difficulties related to performance and correctness. 

The "performance gain" column shows the relative difference in query execution time between the two data sources. A positive percentage indicates that the second source (e.g. ClickHouse) is faster than the primary source (e.g. Elasticsearch), while a negative percentage means it's slower. We recommend starting your analysis by focusing on the dashboard panels most important for you. 

If you notice slower performance for certain panels, you can analyze the specific queries by clicking "Details" and consider manually optimizing the ClickHouse schema accordingly - for example by adjusting the table's `ORDER BY` clause or converting string columns to `LowCardinality(String)` type to improve query efficiency.

The "response similarity" column indicates whether there are any discrepancies between query results from different sources. Similar to performance analysis, we recommend prioritizing the validation of your most critical dashboard panels.

A response similarity value below 100.0% indicates that the sources returned different results. Before investigating these differences in detail, first verify that both sources contain identical data - ensure your ingest process is properly dual-writing and that neither source contains old records. Once data consistency is confirmed, examine the specific differences in the "Details" tab. While minor cosmetic variations may not impact Kibana's visualization, if you discover what appears to be a meaningful difference between sources, please report it by either opening an issue on [Quesma's GitHub repository](https://github.com/QuesmaOrg/quesma/issues/new) or contacting us directly at support@quesma.com.
